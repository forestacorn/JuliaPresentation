# Julia Language Presentation
The Jupyter Notebook files here are from the presentations I gave at a couple of local Linux user groups and BarCamp Birmingham, with the aim of raising awareness of the Julia language and to demonstrate a few of its interesting features.

### Getting Started with Julia
Rather than my presentation notebooks the best starting point for the Julia language is the Julia website http://julialang.org/ and especially the 'learning' page http://julialang.org/learning/, I recommend the "Invitation to Julia" workshop by David P. Sanders at JuliaCon 2015, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ1y5NUD_RI, as a good starting point.

Videos from the recent Julia 2016 Conference, http://juliacon.org/, are now online:

On the Julialang home page, at this time of writing, is a 12 minute video about "the two language problem explaining much of the motivation behind Julia", https://youtu.be/B9moDuSYzGo.

### JuliaBox
You may try Julia online using https://juliabox.org, soon moving to https://juliabox.com, (login using your Google account), they include a Jupyter Notebook environment for code development, which I utilised for my presentation. They also include some short tutorial notebooks to get you started. I intend soon to upload the notebooks I used for my presentation to GitHub so you can view them.

Hope you find that useful and interesting and that you may give Julia a try.
